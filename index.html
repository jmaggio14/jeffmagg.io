        <p><i>My work at this job is covered by an NDA, so details are a little more sparse.</i></p>
        <p>Planetary Resources has a special place in my heart. It is a company with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cctx9X__wQg">mission of exploring, prospecting and mining asteroids</a> to facilitate human expansion into the solar system -- a prospect which excites me greatly</p>

        <p>I am an intern on the instrumentation team at Planetary, the job of which is to develop the instruments used to characterize and explore the asteroids. While the ultimate goal of this team is to develop hardware, there is a significant amount of crossover with the scientific data products - which is an experience I am keen to replicate.</p>
        <p>I think some of the most valuble things I have gotten out of the internship thus far are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An introduction to infrared instrumentation and the associated complexities.</li>
          <li>Lots of exposure planetary and small body science.</li>
          <li>An appreciation for the difficulty of mission planning and the associated systems engineering.</li>
          <!-- <li>Experience in an optical cleanroom and optical testing.</li> -->
        </ul>
        <p>Some things I have worked on include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spearheaded the development of observation simulation software, which contributed to CONOPS planning and algorithm development.</li>
          <li>Research into various types of infrared systems, and the associated complexities.</li>
          <li>Cleanroom benchtop prototype testing and development, with the goal of testing the efficacy of multiple instrument designs. <i>(set to occur in the last months of my internship)</i></li>
        </ul>

          <p><a href="http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20150619-095059646">CIBER2</a> is a sounding rocket instrumentation package meant to characterize the spatial anisotropy of the cosmic infrared background. This takes the form a rocket-mounted 28cm telescope which makes observations in near-infrared outside the atmosphere for approximately 5 minutes before falling back down to earth. (more information available <a href="http://authors.library.caltech.edu/58375/1/Lanz_2014p91433N.pdf">here</a>). The work described here pertains to an independent experimental proof-of-concept payload for this mission.</p>

         <p>My research group's role in this multi-university initiative is to construct a highly accurate attitude determination system used to keep the telescope on target during observation. By using a specialized low-noise CMOS sensor, we can track the deviations in the location of stars in our imagery and direct the rocket to adjust attitude accordingly. As a student engineer on this project, my work involved simplistic FPGA programming and designing interface PCBS to interface with our image sensor. I also spent a lot of time working on various aspects of this system's telemetry: UART device communication, Direct Memory Access and Chapter 10 telemetry decoding.</p>

         <p>This project culminated in a <a href="https://twitter.com/PhilipJLinden/status/845824662919696385">trip to NASA Wallops</a> in March to support integration. Unfortunately, I was forced to leave this project prematurely due to the death of my father and as a result we were unable to integrate the payload in time, pushing back its launch date. However, my time in this project was a fantastic experience and I highly reccomend you check out the work of my boss: <a href="https://www.rit.edu/science/people/michael-zemcov">Michael Zemcov</a>.</p>

          <h3 class="dates text-left">January 2016 - January 2017</h3>
          <p>Shortly after our success at the Hyperloop Design Competition (see below), we were contacted by SpaceX representatives who asked us to construct an inspection robot for the upcoming Hyperloop test track being built at SpaceX headquarters. We graciously accepted, at the same time attempting to continue developing the design concepts which we had presented at Design Weekend (see below). Unfortunately the strain on our resources proved too much and I was forced to drop my pursuit of a patent in a bid to complete the robot by the deadline.</p>

          <p>As Control and Operations Lead, I worked on nearly every aspect of the robot. In addition to working on the image processing used in automated inspection, I also ended up designing a large fraction of the robot's control software, designing and machining the majority of the mechanical components, and designing all the PCBS and other electronics with my collegue <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jai-mehra/">Jai Mehra</a>. The robot was <a href="http://jeffmagg.io/img/rocket.jpg">field tested at SpaceX headquarters in November 2016.</a></p>

          <p>While this project diversified my skillset immensely, the most valuable skills I got out of this project were undoubtably the lessons of thorough documentation and long-term planning -- two things I am now zealous about (Admittedly, they were learned the hard way).</p>

          <h3 class="dates text-left">August 2015 - January 2016</h3>
          <p>Following the annoucement of the international Hyperloop Competition, several friends and I decided to design several imaging system concepts for the competition. Together we formed the RIT Hyperloop Imaging Team and spent a semester developing a comprehensive design briefing for a panel of SpaceX representatives and industry experts. </p>

          <p>If you are unfamiliar with Hyperloop, the folks at wikipedia have an excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop">description</a>.</p>

          <p>I led the development of a high-speed optical (laser) communication system concept that utilized the walls of the hyperloop as a reflecting surface -- theoretically allowing it to reflect a laser pulse off the Hyperloop tube and transmit messages for miles around corners. This subsystem was only ever an unproven concept, however it garnered enough attention that it ended up winning the <a href="http://www.jeffmagg.io/img/award.jpg">Special Innovation Award</a>.</p>

          <!-- <p>I had a very small role in this lab.</p> -->
          <p>The goal of this research was to characterize and determine the mechanisms behind the generation of voice. This involved imaging the sound waves produced by a set of excised canine vocal folds. Sound waves were imaged with the use of an incredibly powerful laser which would illuminate small beads of oil which had been doped into the air prior. The laser was actually so powerful that the experiment would only last milliseconds before the flesh would be irreparably damaged.</p>

          <p>I had a very small part in this lab -- only designing small equipment fixtures and writing small labVIEW programs, however I learned an enormous observing the process and I reccomend that you check out <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985872/">Dr. Oren's work.</a></p>

It was an incredibly good experience as a freshman. However, the sheer amount of work involved with my hyperloop projects precluded me from remaining in SPEX.</p>

            <h3 class="dates text-left">Winter, Spring 2015</h3>
            <p>My first major engineering project experience came in the form of a class. "The Freshman Imaging Project" is a student driven course where students are given a technical paper describing a novel imaging system and told to replicate it within two semesters. My class was told to reconstruct a <a href="http://matthias.hullin.net/publications/HeideEtAl-LowBudgetTransientImaging-SIGGRAPH2013.pdf">low-budget transient imaging system</a>. This technology images (or appoximates) the transient path of light as it propagates through a scene. (Some video examples can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nupEruWNwQo">here</a>).</p>
            <p>Keeping in mind that we were a team of college freshman, this project was highly successful. We ended up reconstructing the system in its entirety (with some generous help from the original authors) and in addition were able to simulate the system in rendering software, compare it to our own experimental data, and thus physically verify our simulation. The end results of our work can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8bra17aoPs&list=PL4oVaJ0uQ_B6juIkyW0FY3S_M1D8h3sGX">here</a>.</p>
            <p>This project was the genesis of my experience with solidworks and electronics, I worked on constructing the system's illumination system (using laser diodes) and designed and subsequently 3D printed the majority of the fixturing used in the setup.</p>
