                I've love exoplanets! I've wanted to study them since I was in high school
            <i>(back in the days when there weren't even 500 confirmed exoplanets)</i>.
                I've tailored my academics towards this goal. I made a custom degree
            at RIT for Experimental Astrophysics, where I take a combination of
            <a>imaging science and physics courses</a>.

                I'm a specialist in imaging and software design, and want to
                put it to use in astronomy!

                I'm a little older than most undergrads (24), and I've spent 3 years
            working alongside school. I've developed processing pipelines and
            a NIR spectrometer for an asteroid mining company, a machine learning
            framework for a rochester imaging company, and spent a year developing
            pipelines and instruments for a lab at the University of Rochester.
