                I love exoplanets! I've wanted to study them since I was in high school
            <i class="i-gray-2">(back in the days when there weren't even 500 confirmed exoplanets)</i>.
                I've tailored my academics towards this goal. I made a custom degree
            at RIT for Experimental Astrophysics, where I take a combination of
            <a>imaging science and physics courses</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a little older than most undergrads (24), and I've spent 3 years
            working alongside school. I've developed processing pipelines and
            a NIR spectrometer for an asteroid mining company, a machine learning
            framework for a Rochester imaging company, and spent a year developing
            pipelines and instruments for a lab at the University of Rochester.
            I also won a special innovation award at a design competition, and
            built an imaging/inspection robot for SpaceX.
            <i class="i-gray-2">(see my resume for details)</i>.

                I'm a specialist in imaging and software design, and I have
            practical experience in instrumentation and hardware. I want to
            put it to use discovering life outside our solar system!

                I feel very strongly that good software accelerates research, while
            bad software can hold it back. To this end, I created
            <a class="proj-link" href="https://www.imagepypelines.org">ImagePypelines</a>
            - an open-source python library built for scientists who might struggle
            with coding. The goal is to build a tool that will let scientists
            develop robust code with only a script. We take care of the coding
            nuance like error checking, modularity, parallelism, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                In essence, ImagePypelines lets scientists create powerful processing pipelines
            at a high level without worrying about the nitty-gritty details
            of coding. We want to make coding more accessible for all scientists,
            and I hope this will help accelerate research moving forward.

                I spent an intense 6 months in Seattle as an intern at
            <a class="proj-link" href="https://www.planetaryresources.com/">Planetary Resources Inc.</a>
            <i class="i-gray-2">(a company that wanted to mine asteroids)</i>. I led the
            development of a pipeline to render simulated
            asteroids given our planned orbital maneuvers around the target body.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also got to work on NIR spectrometer prototypes in the cleanroom
            and learned an enormous amount about planetary and small body sciences! <i class="i-gray-2">(and
            the practical challenges of studying them)</i>.

                This company's mission was very near and dear to my heart - I want to

                Outside of my studies, I enjoy bird watching, listening to history podcasts,
            and spending time with my girlfriend. In general, I'm an
            excitable, albeit sensitive and anxious guy.

                I realized, after I gave a bad presentation last year, how critical
            communication skills are in science. This is a skillset I'm still
            developing, but steadily improving.

                Carl Sagan said in his profound Wanderer's speech
            <i class="i-gray-2">"Maybe it’s a little early. Maybe the time is not quite yet. But those other worlds— promising untold opportunities—beckon"</i>.
            This is the vision that keeps me in love with exoplanets and exoplanet habitability.
